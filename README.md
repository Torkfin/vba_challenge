# vba_challenge
VBA Challenge for GT Bootcamp.
The VB File Contains the Code used to create the output (screenshots) shown in the PPT file.
I included code that calculated the highest % changes and volume increases across all years.  
This is shown in the 2014 Sheet.
Wasn't sure if this was needed, but was a good exercise
